rebol-twitter
=============

Library to use twitter from Rebol R3

This is a direct port of Christopher Ross-Gill's twitter library to Rebol R3

Instructions on use and configuration are here:

http://www.ross-gill.com/page/Twitter_API_and_REBOL

This is alpha level debug only code!

Note that you must still use Rebol 2 to create a twitter users file as this requires https support and the current linux build of Rebol 3 does not include https.
